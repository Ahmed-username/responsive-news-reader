# Responsive News Reader

Let's create a responsive news reader website. To get the latest news the app will display we are going to use [News API](https://newsapi.org/). As with the Weather and Unsplash APIs, you will need to register with the service to obtain an API key.

## Objectives

- [ ] Create a responsive layout that works well and looks good at mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes. Please create the mobile version first, then tablet and then desktop.

- [ ] Fetch news articles from News API and display them including title, image, description, publication, date and link to article.

- [ ] Implement a feature of your choice

## Stretch goals

- [ ] Implement pagination which allows you to get the next 20 results and display them

- [ ] Add search functionality which allows the user to retrieve news about a particular topic

## README.md

When finished, include a README.md in your repo. This should explain what the project is, how to run it and how to use it. Someone who is not familiar with the project should be able to look at it and understand what it is and what to do with it.
